General Objectives
To implement an offline character recognition of scanned images or texts of at most 3 font styles
Specific Objectives
To extract the feature points of each character samples 
To identify characters based on features that are somewhat similar to the features humans use to identify characters 
To create a full text representation of those scanned documents
What is OCR
Offline OCR, optical character recognition refers to the branch of computer science that involves reading text from paper and translating the images into a form that the computer can manipulate (for example, into ASCII codes).
Some OCR Applications
Indexing
Full text retrieval
Full text representation
Full text representation with XML mark-up
How OCR Works
How OCR Works
General Approach
Learning
Back propagation
	     8 input units -> 8 hidden units -> 6 output layers
	26 – A-Z
	10 – 0-9

An image file with the desired characters is created and a text file representing the characters in this image file.

Character
Extract feature points
Corresponding feature points for each character
Recognition Process
Threshold
An image processing technique that minimizes image noise and can convert the text as black and its background as white for easier processing.
		




		Before				   After
Recognition Process
Character Extraction
Detection of lines of text
Detection of connected components
Projection upward and downward to grab dots on "i"s and "j"s
Character Extraction
Line Detection
Horizontal projection
 adjacent lines in the image having a very small number of pixels constitute a line break.
Component Extraction
Starting at the upper right corner of each line, remove touching intervals of black pixels from the run-length-encoded representation of the image until nothing more connected can be found. 
Character Property Extraction
Feature point extraction happens
A feature point is a point of human interest in an image, a place where something happens. It could be an intersection between two lines, or it could be a corner, or it could be just a dot surrounded by space. Such points serve to help define the relationship between different strokes.
Feature Point Extraction
If a pixel is on, its eight neighbors are checked.


Since each neighbor can also only be on or off, there are merely 256 possible combinations of neighborhoods.



Feature Point Extraction
Extracting feature points thus reduced to calculating a number between zero and 256 to describe a pixel's neighborhood and then comparing that number against a table of known feature points (see Table 1, "Enumeration of Possible Pixel Neighborhoods").
Recognition Process
Comparison of Learned & Extracted Characters
it sums the squares of the differences between each property in the extracted character and each property in the learned character, returning a "Confidence"
Recognition Process
Matching Confidence
Additional Operations on Low-Confidence Matches
Splitting Wide Characters
Ex.	ri -> n
If the confidence of the left side of the split higher than before, the character is assumed to be joined, and the split remains. Otherwise, the split is rolled back.
Merging Narrow Characters
An "r" might be split down the middle, leaving an "l"-like figure on the left, and something incomprehensible on the right.
If merging results a higher confidence, merging remains


Recognition Process

The recognition of machine printed characters having numerous applications in various fields attracted equally numerous algorithms to do the task. However the identification of these machine printed characters faces hindrances like the noise that the image is bringing and the variation of font styles among others. This paper explores the application of feature point extraction to the problem of recognizing machine printed characters in an automated manner. Specifically, feature point extraction is used as an algorithm to identify the character under study based on its properties or feature points, not just its shape.
